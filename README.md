# JMeter Evaluation

## Objective
The goal of this project is to evaluate and understand how to perform various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using the provided website, focusing on performance testing.

## Tools Required
- *JMeter*: For conducting performance testing.
- *Firefox*: To record the test steps.

## Pre-requisites
- A solid understanding of Performance Testing concepts.
- JMeter and Firefox should be pre-installed on the system.

---

## Task Overview

### Application Under Test
- *URL*: [Petstore Swagger](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/)

### Tasks to Automate Using JMeter Framework
#### 1. *Everything About Your Pets*  
   Validate the following requests:
   - Add a new pet to the pet store.
   - Update an existing pet.
   - Find a pet by ID.
   - Update a pet in the pet store with form data.
   - Delete a pet.

#### 2. *Access to Pet Store Orders*  
   Validate the following requests:
   - Return inventory by status.
   - Place an order for a pet.
   - Find a purchase order by ID.
   - Delete a purchase order by ID.

---

## Requirements for the Framework
1. Implement the framework using *JMeter*.
2. Create HTTP requests for all required services.
3. Use:
   - *Regular Expressions* for parameter extraction.
   - *Debug Sampler* to monitor and troubleshoot.
4. Configure:
   - Number of threads (users).
   - Ramp-up time.
   - Infinite loops for stress testing.
5. Utilize:
   - Listeners for result visualization.
   - Samplers for request generation.

---

## Steps to Implement
1. Set up a *Test Plan* in JMeter.
2. Add *Thread Groups* for simulating multiple users.
3. Configure HTTP Request Samplers for each endpoint.
4. Use *Regular Expression Extractors* to capture dynamic data (e.g., pet IDs).
5. Add Debug Samplers to verify data flow.
6. Set up *Listeners* such as View Results Tree and Aggregate Report for analyzing performance metrics.
7. Test the application with different configurations for threads, ramp-up times, and loops.

---

## Features
- Comprehensive performance testing of the Petstore API.
- Automated validation of key API endpoints.
- Dynamic data handling using Regular Expressions.
- Detailed performance metrics visualization through JMeter Listeners.

# Bookswagon Automation Project

## Website
[Bookswagon](https://www.bookswagon.com/)

---

## Project Objective
To automate key modules of the Bookswagon website using the Page Object Model (POM) framework. The goal is to streamline testing processes and validate functionality effectively.

---

## Automated Modules
1. *New Arrivals, Best Sellers, Featured Authors, Request a Book*
   - Select a book/item.
   - Add to Cart.
   - Click on *Buy*.

2. *Search Module*
   - Search for the book "Alchemist".
   - Add the book to the cart.
   - View and assert the cart.
   - Click on *Buy*.

---

## Framework Details
- *Design Pattern*: Page Object Model (POM).
- *Test Framework*: TestNG with annotations for test management.
- *Configuration*: 
  - Use a property file for storing values like URL.
  - Implement explicit waits where required.
- *Assertions*: Validate functionality at each step.
- *Screenshots*: Capture as specified during execution.
- *Reporting*: Generate Extent Reports for test results.
- *Project Setup*:
  - Maven project for dependency management and execution.
  - Execute using Maven commands.

---

## Execution Steps
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Set up required dependencies using Maven:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Execute tests:
bash
Copy code
mvn test
